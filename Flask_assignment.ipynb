        "\n",
        "# Web API: A Web API is generally a broader term that encompasses any interface exposed over the web that allows communication and interaction between different software systems. It often refers to RESTful APIs or APIs that follow similar principles.\n",

        "# 2>Protocols and Standards:\n",
        "\n",
